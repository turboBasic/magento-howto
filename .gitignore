# PhpStorm local settings and configurations
# Files inside .idea/: workspace.xml, usage.statistics.xml, and tasks.xml files which store user specific settings
.idea/**/workspace.xml
.idea/**/usage.statistics.xml
.idea/**/tasks.xml

# All the .iml module files that can be located in different module directories (applies to IntelliJ IDEA)
*.iml

# Be careful about sharing the following:
#
# - Android artifacts that produce a signed build (will contain keystore passwords)
# - In IDEA 13 and earlier:
#   - dataSources.ids
#   - datasources.xml can contain database passwords. IDEA 14 solves this problem.
#
#
# You may consider not to share the following:
#
# - .iml files and .idea/modules.xml file for the Gradle or Maven based projects,
#   since these files will be generated on import
# - gradle.xml file, see this discussion
# - user dictionaries folder (to avoid conflicts if other developer has the same name)
# - XML files under .idea/libraries in case they are generated from Gradle or Maven project
